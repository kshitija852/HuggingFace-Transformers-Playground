text = """ Natureâ€™s beauty lies in its endless harmony, where every element seems to belong to a greater masterpiece. Towering mountains, draped in mist, stand proudly against skies painted with hues of sunrise and sunset. Rivers carve their way through valleys, reflecting the sparkle of sunlight like scattered diamonds. Forests whisper with the rustling of leaves, alive with the songs of birds and the gentle hum of life unseen. Meadows bloom with wildflowers, their colors blending into breathtaking tapestries. The sea, ever-changing, mirrors the moods of the sky above. In every corner, nature reminds us of peace, wonder, and timeless perfection. """
